% Is there a most ergodic choice of b? 
% What is the most ergodic choice if you can choose both b and the time horizon T?
We can see that the most ergodic choice for $b$ is attained for a value between $0$ and $0.1$ regardless of the time horizon $T$. 
For the given $T=100$ seconds, the optmizer is attained at $b=0.08$.

If we can also choose $T$, then the most ergodic choice seems to be attained for $T\approx40$ seconds and $b\approx0.05$.
